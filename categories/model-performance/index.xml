      <description>A word of warning. When teaching in the US, I am careful enough to not propose things like &amp;ldquo;consider a binary variable, for instance, gender&amp;rdquo;. But I&amp;rsquo;m currently in Russia where considering gender as a binary variable is not only an acceptable but rather a desired, official position. In Russia you can even get away with some mild swearing. While I never use strong curse words, neither in the classroom nor in private, I occasionally say &amp;ldquo;shit&amp;rdquo;, which is, as I have been warned, not acceptable in US classrooms (while on corridors you can f&amp;hellip; all you want).</description>

      <description>We just finished a lecture and a student came with a question. The lecture was, in short, about how predictive models compute probabilities; to use a model for making decisions, we must find a threshold that will minimize the cost, maximize the profit, strike a good balance between sensitivity and specificity, or increase the general human well-being in some other way. So this student came with a question about something I didn&amp;rsquo;t explain well, and she gave me one last chance.</description>
