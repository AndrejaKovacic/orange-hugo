In the previous post, [Data Mining Covid-19 Epidemics: Part 1](https://orange.biolab.si/blog/2020/2020-04-02-covid-19-basic/), we loaded data about the COVID-19 epidemic and tried some basic visualizations. If you haven't dirtied your hands with it yet, do so.

In this post we will try some maps. We will also extend on the "data mining is interactive" concept by creating some animations to see how the epidemics spread through the world.

## Prerequisite: installing add-ons

Orange already comes with a great selection of widgets that work with all sorts of data. But sometimes we analyze data from specific areas or with specific properties, such as textual data, time series or geographical data, which require specific widgets. Add-ons to the rescue. Add-ons are packages of widgets specially designed to handle specific data types.

In this blog post we will use of Geo and Time series add ons. To install them, select menu *Options* and then *Add-ons*. A new window will show a list of officially supported add-ons. Select Orange3-Geo and Orange3-TimeSeries and click *OK*. After the installation, you will need to restart Orange. Then check the new sections in the widget sidebar for some great new widgets.

**Note:** the two add-ons have recently seen a lot of improvements. If you already have them, use the add-on dialog to upgrade them to the latest version.

## From Scatter Plot to Geo Map

You should already be familiar with the Scatter Plot widget. It can show points at their proper positions on the map, but without the map itself. Of course you can add labels with country names, but this would clog up the image.

{{% figure src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-scatter-plot.png" %}}

The solution is to use Geo Map from the Orange3-Geo add-on. It provides a variety of maps as backgrounds. With them, it's much easier to connect points with locations. To start, first load the [Covid-19 data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv) into Orange by using File widget, as we learned in the previous post]((https://orange.biolab.si/blog/2020/2020-04-02-covid-19-basic/). Then connect File widget with Geo Map. 

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-01.png" %}}

Latitude and longitude attributes are automatically selected. Below them, you can define similar point properties as in the Scatter Plot. The number of cases can be nicely represented by sizes, so select the latest date for *Size*. If you feel adventurous, change the map type to satellite or topological.

{{% figure src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-full-geomap.png" %}}

You can observe other similarities with Scatter Plot. Scroll to zoom in and out. Drag to select data points. Now that we have an image of Europe, selecting its countries doesn't seem that difficult anymore.

{{% figure src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-eu-geomap.png" %}}

## The chloro... chorophl... chloropet..., map with areas colored in.

This already looks really nice. But those similar-sized points on the map represent entire countries from the big Russia to the small Slovenia. It would be much nicer to represent countries by coloring their area. This is the job for the Choropleth Map. Let's connect it.

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-02.png" %}}

This widget is similar to Geo Map just that instead of displaying each data point directly it aggregates them into regions (e.g. Country, State, Province, ...) and displays those instead. Under *Attribute* select the latest date and under *Agg.* select *sum*. The colored regions now show the sum of confirmed covid-19 cases for each country. Now try selecting different dates. You will see how in the beginning there is a lot of growth in China, followed by a period of stagnation. We can also see how in the past week the USA overtook all other countries.

{{% figure src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-choropleth.png" %}}

A warning that *7 points are not in any region* refers to some small islands and to cruise ships included in the data.

## Images are good, animation is better!

As we saw in the previous example, it's nice to observe how countries are doing in different time periods. It would be even better if this could be animated.

It will be, but not before some widget kung fu and the help of a special widget from Orange3-Timeseries: Time Slice. Time Slice select data belonging to a set time window. It can automatically move the window and keep outputing the corresponding data. This is exactly what we need for our animation. Unfortunately, Time Slice expects time points in rows, while our data has them in columns.

### Kill Transpose: Volume 1

Let's start again with the File widget that loads the data. To make our work easier down the line, let's also move *Lat* and *Long* to meta attributes by double clicking  *feature* in the *Role* column and selecting *meta*. This will tell Orange to exclude them from data manipulations.

{{% tooltippic src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-file.gif" %}}

To make the transformation for Time Slice, we will use the Transpose widget. Connect it to File widget.

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-03.png" %}}

Set *From variable* to *Country/Region*. Ignore a warning that indices were added to variables with the same name; it won't hurt us.

{{% tooltippic src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-transpose-1.png" %}}

To better understand what just happened, connect a Data Table to Transpose and see the result: rows and columns are now swapped. Columns are named by countries (because we have chosen *Country/Region* in the Transpose widget), while a new column, *Feature name*, contains the original names of columns.

{{% figure src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-table-1.png" %}}

The next step is to transform the type of *Feature name*. We need to tell Orange that it contains time stamps. For this, we connect Edit Domain widget. 

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-04.png" %}}

Scroll to the bottom of *Variables* and select *Feature name*. In *Edit* change its type to *Time*. While you are at it, change its name to something meaningful like *date*. Finally, click *Apply*

{{% tooltippic src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-edit-domain.gif" %}}

The data is now ready to be processed by Time Slice. Connect and open it. 

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-05.png" %}}

The top part indicates the slice of data that is currently selected. Move the window around or select a new slice. We will manually select a slice of one day by choosing the 25th and 26th January 2020 below the slider. Click on the play button: the slice will start to move and the output will start to update. To verify that it works, connect Data Table and see how the data changes. Then hit the stop button before proceeding.

{{% tooltippic src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-time-slice.png" %}}

### Kill Transpose: Volume 2

We are almost at the finish line, we just need to transform the data back to its original layout. To do so, connect another Transpose widget.

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-06.png" %}}

Under *Future names* select *Generic*, which will name the new column *Feature 1*.

{{% tooltippic src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-transpose-2.png" %}}

Let's do a final check of what our data looks like before inserting it into maps. Looks good.

{{% figure src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-table-2.png" %}}

The final step is connecting the Choropleth Map, selecting *Feature 1* as *Attribute* and *Sum* as the *Agg.*.

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-07.png" %}}

To observe the animation, have both Choropleth and Time Slice opened at the same time. Hit play and observe the beauty.

{{% video src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-animation-choropleth.mp4" %}}

Let's do something similar but with Geo Map widget. For an added bonus let's also remove countries that have zero confirmed cases. This will have the effect that the number of points on the map will increase as the virus is spreading throughout the world. To get that, connect Select Rows.

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-08.png" %}}

Under Conditions select *Feature 1*, *is greater than* and input *0*.

{{% tooltippic src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-select-rows.gif" %}}

To get the best result connect Geo Map and open it. Zoom out so you see the whole world and on the left side check *Freeze map*. This will prevented the map from jumping around as new points are added.

{{% sidework src="/blog_img/2020/2020-04-09-workflow-09.png" %}}

You can now observe the animation in the same way as in Choropleth.

## Where from here?

We learned how to extend Orange's functionality with new widgets from add-ons. We used Orange3-Geo add-on to put Covid-19's numbers on the map. We were also able to create a nice animation showing the spread of the virus. This change could be a good indicator of how countries are fighting the epidemic. Stay tuned for more on that and on Orange3-Timeseries add-on.
